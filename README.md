# Machine Learning

Machine learning library and implementation in C++ for development VS 22.

TBMLGeneticAlgorithm and TBMLMNISTDrawer both use 32-bit SFML, see below for setup.

TBMLNeuralNetwork MNIST examples only read data in 32-bit.

## Setup

1. Install 32-bit SFML from [the website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).

2. Place **/include** and **/lib** libraries here:

   - dependencies/SFML/include/SFML
   - dependencies/SFML/lib
